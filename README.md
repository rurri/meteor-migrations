# Meteor Migrations

A simple migration system for [Meteor](http://meteor.com) supporting up/downwards migrations and command line usage.

Forked from: https://github.com/percolatestudio/meteor-migrations

Substantial Changes have been made to allow reporting on migrations in a UI as well as to invoke migrations from within a UI.
